# Moving Shapes DQN

This repopsitory consists of a game in which 2 dimensional shapes are randomly generated, and can be selected, translated, scaled, and rotated. The game includes a human version with keyboard controls (zoom_game_human.py), and a scripts for training a dqn model to play the game. The dqn model must learn from pixel data how to manipulate the objects from a random initilization to a random target state as quickly as possible.
